# Protozoa Tracking
This is a hobbyist project for finding possible swimming patterns in protozoa. The GIF below demonstrates a prototype of the software that I'm developing in order to capture movement. After tweaking and examining the protozoa in a controlled environment, I'll be able to get much better/clearer results.
